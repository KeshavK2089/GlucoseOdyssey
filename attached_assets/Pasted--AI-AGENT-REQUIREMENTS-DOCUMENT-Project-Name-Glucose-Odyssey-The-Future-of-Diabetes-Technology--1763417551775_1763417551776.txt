Below is the final, polished, agent-ready requirements document written so that any AI Doing Agent (Replit, Claude Artifacts, Cursor, Devin, etc.) can read it and execute it flawlessly. This is not addressed to a human — it is written to the agent itself in operational language.
🚀 AI DOING AGENT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT
Project Title: Glucose Odyssey — A Next-Gen Interactive Diabetes Tech Experience
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW (FOR THE AI AGENT)
You are an AI Doing Agent responsible for building a fully functional, futuristic, interactive web application called Glucose Odyssey.
The website combines two core systems:
System A — Closed-Loop Insulin Simulator
A visual, interactive simulation of:
* CGM glucose readings
* Insulin delivery logic (PID or MPC)
* User-adjustable parameters
* Real-time charts and animations
* “What-if” scenarios (exercise, food, stress, missed bolus, etc.)
System B — AI Literature Scout for Insulin & Diabetes
A backend tool that:
* Fetches recent diabetes research (PubMed or other public APIs)
* Summarizes using an LLM API
* Displays:
   * Key findings
   * Safety/efficacy notes
   * Device innovation trends
   * A short, human-friendly “Why this matters” summary
Both systems must be merged into one beautiful, immersive user experience.
The final output must be uploaded to GitHub and prepared for deployment via GitHub Pages.
2. PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
The AI Agent must:
A. Build an interactive, animated frontend
* Ultra-clean design with dark mode by default
* Futuristic, medical-device-inspired UI
* Smooth scroll and micro-animation
* TailwindCSS (strongly preferred)
* Fully responsive for mobile + desktop
B. Build a backend or serverless function layer
* Lightweight Python or JavaScript backend
* Must call:
   * PubMed API
   * LLM API for summarization (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini — agent chooses)
C. Integrate a real-time simulator
The simulator must:
* Run a simplified glucose-insulin model
* Allow user input:
   * Weight
   * Carb intake
   * Insulin sensitivity factor
   * Basal rate
* Display:
   * Glucose vs. Time
   * Insulin vs. Time
   * Algorithm decisions
* Update visually with animated graphs
D. Build an AI Literature Dashboard
Features:
* “Refresh recent research” button
* Table of new articles
* Fast summaries (≤ 5 lines)
* Creative “impact statements”
* Optional topic filter (ex: “AID systems,” “Type 1,” “pumps,” “CGM,” etc.)
E. Deploy to GitHub Pages
The agent must:
* Create repo
* Push all files
* Set correct GitHub Pages configuration
* Ensure site builds without backend errors (use static JSON mock if necessary)
3. TECH STACK REQUIREMENTS
Frontend
* HTML / CSS / JS
* TailwindCSS (preferred)
* Chart.js or Plotly.js for graphs
* Anime.js, Framer Motion, or GSAP for animations
Backend (Agent chooses)
Option 1:
* Python (FastAPI or Flask) with a static export mode
Option 2:
* Node.js serverless functions
* Optional Cloudflare Workers / Vercel Functions
Constraint: The final deployed version must run entirely on GitHub Pages — use static files or mock data where needed.
APIs
* PubMed E-utilities
* OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini LLM
* The agent chooses optimal endpoints
4. CREATIVE EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS
The website must feel next-generation, immersive, and “alive.”
Mandatory creative elements
* A DNA-helix loading animation
* A futuristic control panel for the insulin simulator
* A “Data Stream” animation showing glucose values scrolling like cyberpunk code
* A neural-network-style background animation on the literature page
* Smooth transitions between sections
* Easter egg:
   * Hovering a CGM point shows a pulse animation
Narrative Tone
The site should feel like:
* part medical device
* part sci-fi control room
* part AI assistant for diabetes
All without sacrificing clarity and readability.
5. PAGE & COMPONENT STRUCTURE
Home Page
* Hero section (dark futuristic aesthetic)
* Motion graphics
* Buttons to “Enter Simulator” and “Explore Research”
Insulin Simulator Page
* User input panel
* Live simulation chart
* Algorithm output log
* Reset + export chart buttons
* Educational tooltips
AI Research Vault Page
* Search bar
* Refresh articles button
* Cards containing:
   * Title
   * Source
   * One-sentence summary
   * “Why it matters” badge
* Expandable detailed view
About / Methodology Page
* Explain:
   * Glucose-insulin model
   * How articles are fetched
   * Limitations
6. FILE STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS
The AI Agent must deliver files arranged like this:

/glucose-odyssey
   /assets
       /css
       /js
       /images
   /simulator
