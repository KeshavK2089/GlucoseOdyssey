## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Glucose Odyssey features a professional medical aesthetic inspired by leading diabetes technology companies:
- **Light mode only** for clinical clarity
- **Purple/navy color palette** (#5941A9, #7F56D9, #2F3A60)
- **Typography:** Source Serif (headings) + Inter (body text)
- **Clean, human-centered design** with subtle animations
- **Professional medical photography** and lifestyle imagery

## ⚠️ Important Information

**For Educational Use Only:** This simulator is designed for learning purposes and should never be used for actual medical decisions or insulin dosing. Always consult with qualified healthcare professionals for diabetes management.

**Limitations:**
- Simplified glucose-insulin model (based on Bergman minimal model)
- AI summaries may not capture all research nuances
- Always refer to original publications for complete information
