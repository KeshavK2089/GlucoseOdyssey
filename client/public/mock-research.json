    "abstract": "Background: Automated insulin delivery systems have shown promise in improving glycemic control. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 24 randomized controlled trials involving 2,847 participants. Results: Hybrid closed-loop systems reduced HbA1c by 0.45% compared to standard insulin therapy (p<0.001). Time in range increased by 12.3% (p<0.001) without increasing hypoglycemia risk. Conclusion: These findings support the efficacy and safety of automated insulin delivery.",
